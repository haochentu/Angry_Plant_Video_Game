I. Game Background 
This game is inspired by my childhood favorite game Plants vs Zombies. I switched the story setting in Plants vs Zombies and added my own story background. 
The story sets at a long time ago, there were three Sunflower Gods which provided all the sunlight all plants need to grow and survive. This setting aligns with the real-world biology as well as real plants do need sunlight to survive. But there is no sun in my game world so Sunflower Gods are the only resource for the plants to survive. So plants are marching towards the sunflowers in the game. Animals in the old world were brave and fearless. They swore to protect the Sunflower Gods. The player will become the leaders of the animals and strategize to defeat all the plants to prevent them from approaching the Sunflower Gods. 

II. Game Summary 
There are three levels. Basically, enemies will enter the screen from the left side and they are walking towards the right, where sunflowers are. Once enemies collide with the sunflower, game over. The user can protect the sunflowers by drag the dropped the animals to the battlefield. Each animal cost different amount of the money and the user will start with $1500 for the first two rounds and $2000 for the last round. If the user can pass all three rounds, the user win.
